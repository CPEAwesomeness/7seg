7 Segment Display demonstration project for CPE201, Fall 2017

## What?:
We had to digitally design a thing, and this is the thing.

It counts from 00 to 99 on two seven-segment displays. We integrated an
Arduino Pro Micro into the project board in order to provide timing functions
for the project's hardware, as well as a firmware backup to demonstrate
creating a hardware-equivalent programmed state machine.
